In April 2022, I configured a cross compiler on my GentooVM1 to match the GenPi64 libraries with these specifications:

    binutils: 2.37
    gcc: 11.2.1
    libc: 2.33

On 4/6/2022, in response to John's inquiry about versions and matching, Logan advised: 

    libc and gcc version need to be perfect matches, and binutils needs to be at least the same major/minor version


On December 31, 2022, I performed an emerge --sync on GentooVM1; I had not upgraded since the assembly of the cross compiler.  When I performed a pretend update, I received this messge:


    jenk /etc/portage/package.accept_keywords # emerge -p dev-libs/libpcre2

     * IMPORTANT: config file '/etc/portage/package.use/zlib' needs updating.
     * See the CONFIGURATION FILES and CONFIGURATION FILES UPDATE TOOLS
     * sections of the emerge man page to learn how to update config files.

    These are the packages that would be merged, in order:

    Calculating dependencies... done!
    [ebuild     U  ] dev-libs/libpcre2-10.40-r1 [10.39] USE="-verify-sig%"

    # These old versions of toolchain packages (binutils, gcc, glibc) are no
    # longer officially supported and are not suitable for general use. Using
    # these packages can result in build failures (and possible breakage) for
    # many packages, and may leave your system vulnerable to known security
    # exploits.
    # If you still use one of these old toolchain packages, please upgrade (and
    # switch the compiler / the binutils) ASAP. If you need them for a specific
    # (isolated) use case, feel free to unmask them on your system.

    - sys-libs/glibc-2.33-r13::gentoo (masked by: package.mask)

So, this conflict raises the question of coordinating cross compilers with releases of GenPi64. The last successful build of GenPi64 Lite is October 8, 2022.
