[3:07:15 PM] <JohnPoole> I would like to understand what triggers an upgrade of 1)binutils, 2) gcc, & 3) libc as I am trying to coordinate cross-compilers for the GenPi64 project that builds a Gentoo image for the Raspberry Pi.  Is the decision to "go live" with a given version documented anywhere?

there's usually some discussion in #gentoo-toolchain over it, and usually a bug gets filed a while beforehand (stabilisation bug)
the general rule for stabilisation is after 30 days if no reported bugs, it's more (longer, often a lot longer) for critical stuff like those
for major versions, anyway
for new revisions/patches from upstream then it's not so long of course

So bug db might be a good place to search for the history of the changes?  Otherwise, I'm thinking I need to monitor the CONTENTS file staged with the builds.

@sam_ 15:10:59
yes, bugzilla would be a good place to watch
(you can even watch specific users on bugzilla, so could watch toolchain@gentoo.org0
)
